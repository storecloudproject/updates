STORE is publishing a bimonthly update on its work on Governance for the governance team. This update is for Dec. 22 - Jan. 4.

Chris. Charged team with raising TYN and other research papers to come to IEEE standards. Introduced Bryan from Mousebelt and discussed development of the application stack for STORE. Developing product requirement documentation on application stack is the next step, with the ultimate goal of leveraging the platform application to enable web2 and legacy companies to move to web3 through Store's governance token and tooling. Queued up the economic paper in parallel to the governance paper currently in development, which will be a collaboration between Chris, Matt Sherry, and our team of Store analysts. Provided an update on the Store Foundation spin-up and transfer, which will involve shifting significant assets to whichever country is chosen, including IP.

Craig. Updated team on the current state of the TYN paper, with open discussions on the most effective way to present comparisons to peer tokens and governance systems, as well as promising research on other approaches to trust in complex systems. Next steps are to provide an outline to Chris and bring the paper into compliance with IEEE standards.

Andre. Finalizing comparative coin and token research with a potential link to the TYN governance paper.

Bryan. Introduced and welcomed to the governance team. Iterating on application stack for Second Governance.

Charles. Updated on current thinking between Switzerland v. Liechtenstein with regards to DAOs, primarily working at the intersection of legal and software code. Iterating on TYN paper with Craig to meet IEEE standards.
